# Terminal Practice - Make Class Directories

### Context
We need to organize the directories for the class. We will need to use the `cd`, `mkdir`, and `ls` commands

### The Warmup

1. Navigate to your user-home directory (`~`)
2. Create a directory called `muktek`
3. Navigate inside `muktek`
4. From the `~/muktek` directory the following folder structure:
  -
  ```
	+ muktek
	   |
	   +-- assignments
	   |
	   +-- labs
	   |  
	   +-- sandbox
	   |    
	   +-- notes
  ```



### Extension

Put your first homework assignment in a folder called `01-basic-html-rothko` the `muktek/assignments/` directory.
